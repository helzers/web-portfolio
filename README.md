# My Portfolio

I created this website as a place to display my projects and information, and also show some creativity.<br/>
This website uses ReactJS and SASS, and is my second ReactJS project.<br/>

To view the ReactJS code and the SASS code for this project, switch to the master branch instead of the gh-pages branch

You can view the website at this link:

## Adobe XD

I used AdobeXD to created high fidelity mock ups of the website before I began implementation.<br/>
I designed a few versions of this website as I was enjoying using AdobeXD and wanted to express my personality in the website.<br/>

You can view the AdobeXD project **[here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e852151f-57c4-4b10-9dde-345fd35d7c89-bd01/grid/)**<br/>

The projects includes all the versions I designed of the webite.<br/>

<br/>

## Adobe Illustrator

This was my first time using Adobe Illustrator. I used this to create the SVG Lines that I used for the headers. I needed to created them myself so they would fit the website. I also wanted to be able to set beginning of the SVG path so the CSS Animations would begin in the correct postion. While this was a very basic use of Adobe Illustrator it has intriguted me and I plan to learn more.<br/>

<br/>

## Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom

I used Adobe Photoshop to create the simple logo that is used as the tab favicon, in the page footer and in the navbar in the mobile version of the site.<br/>
I also used Photoshop and Lightroom to make some edits to the photos used in the website, such as removing backgrounds, adding blur to the otherwise busy Home Page header, making some photos black and white, and changing the colors of certian elements to match the color palette of the website.<br/>

<br/>

## Home Page

The Home page features several sections such as the welcome header, about me, and education.<br/>
The welcome header has an image of me and a welcome message with some fade in CSS animation to bring the page to life.<br/>
The About Me section has an image of me and a small bio. This also feature an SVG path with a CSS animation that reveals the line as the user scrolls.<br/>
The Education Section features my previous education as well as another SVG Line that reacts to the users scroll.<br/>

<br/>

## Work Page

This page shows both my previous work and volunteer work.<br/>
The header of this page features a few CSS animations again to give the page more life. There are 2 SVG lines that animate on load rather than scroll and an underline that reveals after the SVG lines to highlight the Header.<br/>

<br/>

## Project Page

This page is where I display all the projects I've worked on, including pictures, links to their GitHub Repos and AdobeXD projects.<br/>
There is also a section to discuss some of the larger college projects I worked on.<br/>

<br/>

## Contact Me Page

This page can only be accessed through the footer of the website.<br/>
It features my email, another link to my LinkedIn profile and a Contact me form.<br/>
The Contact Me form uses EmailJS to send the inputs of this form to my email address.
