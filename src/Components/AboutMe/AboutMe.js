                <p id="aboutMeBio">I graduated from Computer Science International, TUD in May
                 2019. Soon after I moved to Madrid, Spain to work as a Software Engineer in 
                 Openjaw.  I was let go in April 2020 due to coronavirus, and moved back to 
                 Ireland in August 2020. Since then Iâ€™ve been searching for a new job and 
                 improving my skills by learning ReactJS, SASS and Adobe XD</p>
